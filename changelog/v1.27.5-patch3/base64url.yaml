  description: >-
    Expose `base64url_encode` and `base64url_decode` Inja transformers, which are new transformations that will fall back to attempting to decode Base64Url if Base64 decoding fails. These are provided as new options, and the existing ones remain unchanged to preserve backward compatibility in case users are relying on current behavior. This can happen especially when attempting to decode JWTs.
