  description: >-
    Refactor transformation filter to use discrete `RequestTransformer`, `ResponseTransformer`, and `OnStreamCompleteTransformer`.
    In this way, we can have more safety around transformers that may only be run in a particular case, or may behave differently
    depending on when they are running.
